                <p>An advertising cookie is used to display advertisements that are targeted at visitors of the website to ensure that

                Web bugs really function in the same way as cookies. Web bugs are used to follow the visitor traffic from one

            <div class="heading"> STUS DATA BREACH POLICY</div>
 
<p class="subHead">Introduction</p>

<p>Standard Union Securities Limited collects, holds, processes, and shares personal data, a valuable asset that needs to be suitably protected.
 
Every care is taken to protect personal data from incidents (either accidentally or deliberately) to avoid a data protection breach that could compromise security.
 
Compromise of information, confidentiality, integrity, or availability may result in harm to individual(s), reputational damage, detrimental effect on service provision, legislative non-compliance, and/or financial costs.
</p>

<p class="subHead">Purpose and Scope</p>
 
<p>Standard Union Securities Limited is obliged under Data Protection legislation to have in place an institutional framework designed to ensure the security of all personal data during its life cycle, including clear lines of responsibility.
 
This policy sets out the procedure to be followed to ensure a consistent and effective approach is in place for managing data breach and information security incidents across Standard Union Securities Limited    .
 
This policy relates to all personal and special categories (sensitive) data held by Standard Union Securities Limited regardless of format.
 
This policy applies to all employee of Standard Union Securities Limited. This includes temporary, out-source or agency staff and contractors, consultants, suppliers and data processors working for, or on behalf of the Standard Union Securities Limited.
 
The objective of this policy is to contain any breaches, to minimise the risk associated with the breach and consider what action is necessary to secure personal data and prevent further breaches.
</p> 
 
 
 
<p class="subHead">Definitions / Types of breach</p>
 
•	For the purpose of this policy, data security breaches include both confirmed and suspected incidents.
 
•	An incident in the context of this policy is an event or action which may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of systems or data, either accidentally or deliberately, and has caused or has the potential to cause damage to the Standard Union Securities Limited information assets and / or reputation.

•	An incident includes but is not restricted to, the following:
 
•	loss or theft of confidential or sensitive data or equipment on which such data is stored (e.g. loss of laptop, USB stick, iPad / tablet device, or paper record);
•	equipment theft or failure;
•	system failure;
•	unauthorised use of, access to or modification of data or information systems;
•	attempts (failed or successful) to gain unauthorised access to information or IT system(s);
•	unauthorised disclosure of sensitive / confidential data;
•	website defacement;
•	hacking attack;
•	unforeseen circumstances such as a fire or flood;
•	human error;
•	‘blagging’ offences where information is obtained by deceiving the organisation who holds it.
 
 
<p class="subHead">	Reporting an incident</p>
 
Any individual who accesses, uses or manages Standard Union Securities Limited
information is responsible for reporting data breach and information
security incidents immediately to the Data Protection Officer via dpo@standardun.com
 
•	If the breach occurs or is discovered outside normal working hours, it must be reported as soon as is practicable.
 
•	The report must include full and accurate details of the incident, when the breach occurred (dates and times), who is reporting it, if the data relates to people, the nature of the information, and how many individuals are involved. An Incident Report Form should be completed as part of the reporting process (refer to [The data Breach report form]).
 
<p class="subHead">Containment and recovery</p>
 
•	The Data Protection Officer (DPO) will first determine if the breach is still occurring. If so, the appropriate steps will be taken immediately to minimise the effect of the breach.
 
•	An initial assessment will be made by the DPO in liaison with relevant officer(s) to establish the severity of the breach and who will take the lead investigating the breach, as the Lead Investigation Officer (this will depend on the nature of the breach; in some cases it could be the DPO).
 
•	The Data Protection Officer will establish whether there is anything that can be done to recover any losses and limit the damage the breach could cause.
 
•	The Data Protection Officer will establish who may need to be notified as part of the initial containment and will inform the police, where appropriate.
  
•	The Data Protection Officer, in liaison with the relevant officer(s) will determine the suitable course of action to be taken to ensure a resolution to the incident.
  
•	Investigation and risk assessment
 
•	An investigation will be undertaken by the DPO with the Head of Information Technology / Head Internal Control department immediately and wherever possible, within 24 hours of the breach being discovered / reported.
 
•	The DPO with the Head of Information Technology / Head of Internal Control department will investigate the breach and assess the risks associated with it, for example, the potential adverse consequences for individuals, how serious or substantial those are and how likely they are to occur.
 
•	The investigation will need to take into account the following:
o	the type of data involved;
o	its sensitivity;
o	the protections in place (e.g. encryptions);
o	what has happened to the data (e.g. has it been lost or stolen;
o	whether the data could be put to any illegal or inappropriate use;
o	data subject(s) affected by the breach, number of individuals involved and the potential effects on those data subject(s);
o	whether there are wider consequences to the breach.

<p class="subHead">	Notification</p>
 
•	The DPO with the Head of Information Technology / Head of Internal Control department, in consultation with relevant colleagues will establish whether the Authority will need to be notified of the breach, and if so, notify them within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, where feasible.
•	Every incident will be assessed on a case by case basis; however, the following will need to be considered:
o	whether the breach is likely to result in a high risk of adversely affecting individuals’ rights and freedoms under Data Protection legislation;
o	whether notification would assist the individual(s) affected (e.g. could they act on the information to mitigate risks?);
o	whether notification would help prevent the unauthorised or unlawful use of personal data;
o	whether there are any legal / contractual notification requirements;
o	the dangers of over notifying. Not every incident warrants notification and over notification may cause disproportionate enquiries and work.

•	Individuals whose personal data has been affected by the incident, and where it has been considered likely to result in a high risk of adversely affecting that individual’s rights and freedoms, will be informed without undue delay. Notification will include a description of how and when the breach occurred and the data involved. Specific and clear advice will be given on what they can do to protect themselves, and include what action has already been taken to mitigate the risks. Individuals will also be provided with a way in which they can contact Standard Union Securities Limited for further information or to ask questions on what has occurred.

The Data Protection Officer must consider notifying third parties such as the police, insurers, banks or credit card companies. This would be appropriate where illegal activity is known or is believed to have occurred, or where there is a risk that illegal activity might occur in the future.
  
•	A record will be kept of any personal data breach, regardless of whether notification was required.


<p class="subHead">	Evaluation and response</p>
 
•	Once the initial incident is contained, the DPO will carry out a full review of the causes of the breach; the effectiveness of the response(s) and whether any changes to systems, policies and procedures should be undertaken.
•	Existing controls will be reviewed to determine their adequacy, and whether any corrective action should be taken to minimise the risk of similar incidents occurring.
 
•	The review will consider:
o	where and how personal data is held and where and how it is stored;
o	where the biggest risks lie including identifying potential weak points within existing security measures;
o	whether methods of transmission are secure; sharing minimum amount of data necessary;
o	staff awareness;
o	implementing a data breach plan and identifying a group of individuals responsible for reacting to reported breaches of security.
•	If deemed necessary, a report recommending any changes to systems, policies and procedures will be considered by Standard Union Securities Limited.
 
<p class="subHead">	Policy Review</p>
•	This policy will be updated as necessary to reflect best practice and to ensure compliance with any changes or amendments to relevant legislation.

THIS POLICY WAS REVIEWED IN FEBRUARY 2020.

•	Be informed whether the information is being disclosed to anyone apart from the original recipient of the data; and if so, the identity of those recipients.
•	The right of data portability. Data subjects can ask that their personal data be transferred to them or a third party in machine readable format (Word, PDF, etc.). However, such requests can only be fulfilled if the data in question is: 1) provided by the data subject to the Company, 2) is processed automatically and 3) is processed based on consent or fulfilment of a contract.
•	If the data is being used to make automated decisions about the data subject, to be told what logic the system uses to make those decisions and to be able to request human intervention. The Company must provide a response to data subjects requesting access to their data within 30 calendar days of receiving the Data Subject Access Request unless local legislation dictates otherwise.


<p class="subHead">	Requirements for a valid DSAR</p>
o	In order to be able to respond to the Data Subject Access Requests in a timely manner, the data subject should:
	Submit his/her request using a Data Subject Access Request Form.
	Provide the Company with sufficient information to validate his/her identity (to ensure that the person requesting the information is the data subject or his/her authorized person).
o	Subject to the exemptions referred to in this document, the Company will provide information to data subjects whose requests are in writing (or by some other method explicitly permitted by the local law), and are received from an individual whose identity can be validated by Company.
o	However, Company will not provide data where the resources required to identify and retrieve it would be excessively difficult or time-consuming. Requests are more likely to be successful where they are specific and targeted at particular information.
o	Factors that can assist in narrowing the scope of a search include identifying the likely holder of the information (e.g. by making reference to a specific department), the time period in which the information was generated or processed (the narrower the time frame, the more likely a request is to succeed) and being specific about the nature of the data sought (e.g. a copy of a particular form or email records from within a particular department).
 
<p class="subHead">	DSAR process</p>
<p class="subHead">	Request</p>
Upon receipt of a DSAR, the Data Protection Team will log and acknowledge the request. The requestor may be asked to complete a Data Subject Access Request Form to better enable the Company to locate the relevant information.
<p class="subHead">	Identify verification</p>
The Data Protection Team needs to check the identity of anyone making a DSAR to ensure information is only given to the person who is entitled to it. If the identity of a DSAR requestor has not already been provided, the person receiving the request will ask the requestor to provide two forms of identification, one of which must be a photo identity and the other confirmation of address.
If the requestor is not the data subject, written confirmation that the requestor is authorized to act on behalf of the data subject is required.
<p class="subHead">	Information for DSAR</p>
Upon receipt of the required documents, the person receiving the request will provide the Data Protection Team with all relevant information in support of the DSAR. Where the Data Protection Team is reasonably satisfied with the information presented by the person who received the request, the Data Protection Officer will notify the requestor that his/her DSAR will be responded to within 30 calendar days. The 30 day period begins from the date that the required documents are received. The requestor will be informed by the Data Protection Team in writing if there will be any deviation from the 30 day time-frame due to other intervening events.
<p class="subHead">	Review of Information</p>
The Data Protection Team composed of cross department representative will collate the relevant and required information as requested in the DSAR.
The Data Protection Team must ensure that the information is reviewed/received by the imposed deadline to ensure the 30 calendar day time-frame is not breached. The Data Protection Officer will ask the relevant department to complete a “Data Subject Disclosure Form” to document compliance with the 30 day requirement.

<p class="subHead">	Response to access requests</p>
The Data Protection Team will provide the finalized response together with the information retrieved and/or a statement that the Company does not hold the information requested, or that an exemption applies.
The Data Protection Team will ensure that a written response will be sent back to the requestor. This will be via email, unless the requestor has specified another method by which they wish to receive the response (e.g. post).
The Company will only provide information via channels that are secure. When hard copies of information are posted, they will be sealed securely and sent by recorded delivery.

<p class="subHead">	Archiving</p>
After the response has been sent to the requestor, the DSAR will be considered closed and archived by the Data Protection Team.
 
<p class="subHead">	Exemptions</p>
o	An individual does not have the right to access information recorded about someone else, unless they are an authorized representative.
 
•	The Company is not required to respond to requests for information unless it is provided with sufficient details to enable the location of the information to be identified, and to satisfy itself as to the identity of the data subject making the request.
 
•	In principle, the Company will not normally disclose the following types of information in response to a Data Subject Access Request:
 
•	Information about other people – A Data Subject Access Request may cover information which relates to an individual or individuals other than the data subject. Access to such data will not be granted, unless the individuals involved consent to the disclosure of their data.
•	Repeat requests – Where a similar or identical request in relation to the same data subject has previously been complied with within a reasonable time period, and where there is no significant change in personal data held in relation to that data subject, any further request made within a six month period of the original request will be considered a repeat request, and the Company will not normally provide a further copy of the same data
•	Publicly available information – The Company is not required to provide copies of documents which are already in the public domain.
•	Opinions given in confidence or protected by copyright law – The Company does not have to disclose personal data held in relation to a data subject that is in the form of an opinion given in confidence or protected by copyright law.
 
 


<p class="subHead">	DSAR Refusals</p>
There are situations where individuals do not have a right to see information relating to them. For instance:
•	If the information is kept only for the purpose of statistics or research, and where the results of the statistical work or research are not made available in a form that identifies any of the individuals involved.
•	Requests made for other, non-data protection purposes can be rejected.
•	If the responsible person refuses a Data Subject Access Request on behalf of the Company, the reasons for the rejection must be clearly set out in writing. Any individual dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her Data Subject Access Request is entitled to make a request to the Data Protection Officer to review the outcome.

<p class="subHead">	Responsibilities</p>
o	The overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with a DSAR rests with the Data Protection Officer.
o	If the Company acts as a data controller towards the data subject making the request then the DSAR will be addressed based on the provisions of this procedure.
o	If the Company acts as a data processor the Data Protection Officer will forward the request to the appropriate data controller on whose behalf the Company processes personal data of the data subject making the request.

        <div class="heading"> BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN</div>
        Background
The objective of Information Security, Business Continuity Management and Back-Up
Arrangement (BCM) is to ensure the timely resumption and delivery of essential business
activities in the event of service disruption by maintaining the key business resources required to
support delivery of those activities. The primary aim of this policy is to create a plan for mitigating
some of an organization’s risks.
SOURCES OF DISRUPTION
In the course of our business over the years, we have identified some common sources of service
failure which includes:
1. Internet failure :
Since all our business operations are done online, internet has become a very critical
factor in our day to day business operations. However, due to the peculiarities of our
operating environment, the internet sometime fails resulting in our inability to carry out
some of the required operations.
2. System Failure:
In some cases, software issues, or even hardware issues may affect our ability to attend
to our clients. Some of these issues include Operating system crash, software failure or
malfunctioning among others.
3. Server failure from our OMS vendor:
There is a possibility of system failure from our vendor even though not yet experienced;
it is, however, considered a possibility. If this occurs, some parts of our business activities
shall be disrupted.
Business Continuity Plan, Standard Union Securities Limited. 2
PLANS TO MITIGATE ABOVE IDENTIFIED THREAT
1. Internet failure:
In order to avoid service disruption as a result of internet failure, we shall always subscribe
to the services of two or more internet service providers in order to enable us switch to
whichever is working at the time of any particular failure. This implies that we shall have
more than one 4g routers that we can switch the entire network to whenever there is a
down time from any of the providers.
2. System Failure:
The IT department must be equipped with personnel that can attend to issues arising
from computer hardware and software, in order to promptly fix the affected systems.
3. Server failure from our OMS vendor:
We shall always have a disaster recovery site (a separate environment not hosted on the
same server with the main software applications) where we can move the last database
backup into in order to continue business operations without delay. This must be
discussed with our vendor Programos, in order to work out the best model to recover
from which ever failure that may occur in this regard.
